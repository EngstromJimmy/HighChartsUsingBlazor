There are loads of Blazor 3rd party vendors, but it is still very early and some features are missing.
Before we started porting our sites to Blazor we used Highcharts and we decided that we want to continue using Highcharts for a little bit longer (until the vendors add what we need).

I have seen other projects trying to port Highcharts to .NET classes (or at least for the configuration) but the downside is that you can't use the documentation to figure out how to create a chart.
I wanted my solution to be simple to use (if you already used Highcharts or want to use their documentation), no need to convert from JSON to .NET.
I didn't want to involve NPM (one of the things I love most about Blazor is that I don't need NPM).

You can read more on how to use it here: http://engstromjimmy.se/post/2020-03-21-UsingHighchartsWithBlazor
